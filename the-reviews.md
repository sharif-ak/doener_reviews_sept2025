Döner Ratings

#1 Harput, Wiesbaden
Overall: 7.5/10
Service: 10/10 Nice people, was very busy but got to order quickly, could pick table and the Döner came quick. Also gave me a complimentary pastry.
Price: 10/10 Only 8€ i was pleasantly surprised.
Meat: 7/10 Nothing bad, good quality and quantity, just was a bit monotone in flavour.
Bread: 8.5/10 Good, but particularly memorable.
Salad: 8.5/10 Good and fresh, ordered without iceberg but they mixed the iceberg with the red cabbage so i was missing that.
Sauce: 6.5/10 Ordered Garlic sauce, it was yellow = mustard. Didn’t taste bad but not my type of Garlic Sauce.
Feel after: 8.5/10 Was not heavy, doesn’t make you feel sluggish. Satisfied.
Portion: 8/10 Value for money. Not too small. Filling enough.
